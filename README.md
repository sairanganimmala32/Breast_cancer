# Brief About The DatasetÂ¶
The dataset includes various features representing cell nucleus characteristics. These features are computed and categorized into mean, standard error, and the largest values for:

1. **id**
2. **diagnosis:** M = malignant, B = benign
Columns 3 to 32 contain ten real-valued features for each cell nucleus:

3. **radius:** distance from the center to points on the perimeter
4. **texture:** standard deviation of gray-scale values
5. **perimeter**
6. **area**
7. **smoothness:** local variation in radius lengths
8. **compactness:** perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
9. **concavity: **severity of concave portions of the contour
10. **concave points:** number of concave portions of the contour
11. **symmetry**
12. **fractal dimension:** "coastline approximation" - 1
