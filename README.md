# Brief About The DatasetÂ¶
The dataset includes various features representing cell nucleus characteristics. These features are computed and categorized into mean, standard error, and the largest values for:

id
**diagnosis:** M = malignant, B = benign
Columns 3 to 32 contain ten real-valued features for each cell nucleus:

**radius:** distance from the center to points on the perimeter
**texture:** standard deviation of gray-scale values
**perimeter**
**area**
**smoothness:** local variation in radius lengths
**compactness:** perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
**concavity: **severity of concave portions of the contour
**concave points:** number of concave portions of the contour
**symmetry**
**fractal dimension:** "coastline approximation" - 1
